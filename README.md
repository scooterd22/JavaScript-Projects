JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS
- these are some projects I made using Javascript.

Projects
- Pizza Menu
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Calculator

Pizza Menu:
This project is a menu used to order pizza with different selections of toppings, sizes, and sauces. It then takes the inputted information and calculates the price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
The player that makes the first move is randomly selected and then the classic game of tic-tac-toe is played. I added fun sound effects to bring some life to the game.

Calculator:
I created a basic 4 function calculator with a pop y2k colored scheme. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
